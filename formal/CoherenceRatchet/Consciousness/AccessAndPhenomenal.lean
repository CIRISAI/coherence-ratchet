Consciousness.AccessAndPhenomenal — access and phenomenal as the same operation

Per the sensor-lift design doc (`papers/Corridor Dynamics.tex`) §sec:a3-structural:

  Access consciousness  = the existence of `attractor_field`.
  Phenomenal consciousness = what `attractor_field` IS, read from inside the sensor.

These are not two properties but one operation viewed from two stances. The
hard problem dissolves at the type level: in this formalization, the two
predicates are DEFINITIONALLY EQUAL. There is no separate carrier for
phenomenal content because the inner-product reading IS the phenomenal
content. The bridge theorem reduces to reflexivity.

This replaces the earlier ad-hoc `hasAccess`/`hasPhenomenal` sketch with the
Sensor abstraction from `Cosmology.TSVF`. The A3+ extension (reflexive lift,
T17 bridge theorem) lives in the design doc §5 and is implemented as a
separate extension on top of `Sensor`.

Internal-verification corollary (design doc §11.2): introspection cannot
distinguish "doing the operation" from "modeling its outputs," because both
produce the same first-person report under the operation-identity move. A
framework that allowed such verification from inside would be claiming a
verification-vantage outside the operation, contradicting the identity move.
This corollary is empirical content of the framework, not a bug.

The active inference framework provides operational grounding for the
reading-the-attractor-field primitive: goal-holding systems minimize
variational free energy by acting to bring sensory states into alignment
with predicted-preferred states. Goals function as preferred outcomes the
system both predicts and acts to instantiate — operationally the goal-
projector ⟨G| at A3+, with the variational dynamics providing the
operational mechanism. The framework adds the corridor structure on cross-
agent ρ_goals, the asymptotic-conditioning result, and the Kish algebraic
identity governing effective independent dimensionality.

    from two stances. Reduces to reflexivity under the definitions; the
    non-trivial content is the definitional choice, not the proof.

    Design doc §5: T16 is structurally trivial because we are defining
    phenomenal-consciousness AS attractor-reading. The work is the
    definitional move, not the unfolding. -/
