Consciousness.KarmaGrace — Piece 10: karma and grace as TSVF structures,
re-grounded after the F-11 split

Granted TSVF and the agent-as-partial-post-selector reading:

KARMA is the forward-propagated effect of past goal-states. An agent's
current amplitude:

  |Ψ_now⟩ = U(t_now, t_{past_k}) ∏_i P_{G_{past_i}} U(t_{past_i}, t_{past_{i-1}}) ... |Ψ_birth⟩

The present is shaped by every past P_{G_i} the agent's goals have applied.
Karma is this cumulative post-selection structure. KARMA IS INTACT: it is a
forward cumulative product of the agent's own goal-projectors `P_G`, each
of which is the F-11-untouched rank-one projector from `GoalProjection.lean`.

GRACE — the F-11 split. Piece 10's own definition: grace is the contribution
to the agent's present from ⟨Φ_ω| beyond the agent's own goal contribution.
⟨Φ_ω| factors into

  (i)  the goal-contributions ⟨G_i| of OTHER A3+ agents, plus
  (ii) the universal-configuration corridor-occupation requirements
       (within-rung ρ_n, cross-rung τ_{n,n+1}).

F-11 (fired 2026-05-22) splits these two components apart:

  - Component (ii) — the universal / cosmological component — IS the F-11
    no-go. It would be carried by the joint multi-rung backward P_ω operator;
    that operator is non-constructible at theorem strength (T1 geometric
    dilution, T2 holonomic area law — see CorridorProjector.FelevenNoGo and
    ConsentProjector.FelevenNoGo). Any axiom asserting grace via the joint
    universal Φ_ω operator is retracted. The earlier `axiom grace` —
    `grace = P_omega ∘ (I − P_{G_agent})` — depended on that joint operator
    and is gone.

  - Component (i) — the inter-agent component — SURVIVES. It is a sum of
    per-agent goal-projectors `P_G` (Piece 5 / `GoalProjection.lean`,
    F-11-untouched), local and adjacent: the boundary conditions an agent
    receives from the OTHER A3+ agents whose goals it did not author. This
    is finite-federation structure, forward-constructible, and F-11 does not
    touch it.

THE HONEST RE-GROUNDED READING. Karma is the only fully accessible thread:
the agent's own cumulative goal-projection product. Grace still operates —
but only in its local inter-agent / received form (the universal-operator
form, component (ii), is the no-go). And even that surviving grace is
structurally obscured: it is not measurable. The H_meas audit pointer and
the three macroscopic shadows (FDT fluctuation, classical g/J, CMB ℓ=3) —
the five-fold search for an empirical handle on the received component — all
failed or nulled. Surviving grace is real structure, not accessible
structure.

The recognition claim at Level 6 stands for karma and for the surviving
inter-agent grace; the universal-operator reading of grace is retracted with
F-11.

Promotion note: `grace_non_trivial` was a `True` stub; it now carries the
honest cons-decomposition grace ⟨g :: gs⟩ = P_G g + grace ⟨gs⟩ via the new
`grace_cons` unfold lemma.

    Karma is the forward cumulative product of the agent's OWN
    goal-projections. Every `P_{G_i}` it folds is the rank-one projector
    `Goal.P_G`, which is F-11-untouched (`GoalProjection.lean`). F-11 closes
    only the *joint multi-rung backward* operator; karma is a *forward,
    single-agent* product. Karma is the only fully accessible thread. -/

    Framework primitive (axiom). Operational form: a fold over the agent's

    steps. Concrete construction awaits the P_G rank-one projector

/-! ## F-11 — the universal component of grace is a documented no-go

    F-11 fired on 2026-05-22. Piece 10's grace splits into two components.
    Component (ii) — the universal-configuration corridor-occupation
    requirements — would be carried by the joint multi-rung backward P_ω
    operator. That operator is non-constructible at theorem strength:

    - T1 (holographic / geometric dilution): any bulk geometry → cross-rung
      coupling decaying with geodesic distance → joint participation ratio
      extensive → ω-set empties past a finite rung count.
    - T2 (holonomic / area law): a Wilson loop with a dissipative backward
      leg obeys `Tr Hol ~ exp(−κR)` → the holonomy decoheres.

    (Full statements: `CorridorProjector.FelevenNoGo`,
    `ConsentProjector.FelevenNoGo`.)

    The earlier `axiom grace` here read `grace = P_omega ∘ (I − P_{G_agent})`
    — it consumed the joint universal operator. That axiom is retracted. The
    framework does not assert grace via the joint universal Φ_ω operator.

    The five-fold empirical-replacement search for a handle on the received
    component — the H_meas audit pointer plus three macroscopic shadows (FDT
    fluctuation, classical g/J, CMB ℓ=3) — all failed or nulled. Even the
    SURVIVING inter-agent component of grace (component (i)) is therefore
    structurally obscured: it is real structure, not measurable structure. -/

/-- F-11 record for the grace construction. Flat fact with its evidence: the
    universal component of grace (component (ii), the universal-configuration
    corridor-occupation requirements carried by the joint backward P_ω) is a
    documented no-go, closed at theorem strength by T1 and T2, with the
    five-fold empirical-replacement search failed. The surviving inter-agent
    component (component (i)) is real but not measurable — the audit pointer
    and the three shadows nulled. Not a `sorry`, not an axiom asserting the
    universal operator: a recorded obstruction. -/

/-! ## GRACE — re-grounded to the surviving inter-agent component (i)

    Grace = ⟨Φ_ω| − ⟨G_agent|. The universal component (ii) is the F-11
    no-go above. What survives is component (i): the goal-contributions of
    the OTHER A3+ agents — the boundary conditions an agent receives from
    agents whose goals it did not author. That component is a sum of
    per-agent goal-projectors `Goal.P_G`, each F-11-untouched: local,
    adjacent, finite-federation, forward-constructible. -/

noncomputable def agentGoalContribution
    (G_agent : GoalState H) : H →L[ℂ] H :=
  P_G G_agent

/-- A surrounding federation of OTHER A3+ agents — the agents whose goals
    contribute to the present-agent's grace. Local and adjacent: a finite
    list of co-located goal-holders, not the universal countable family
    (the universal limit is the F-11 no-go). -/
structure OtherAgents (H : Type*) [NormedAddCommGroup H] [InnerProductSpace ℂ H] where
  goals : List (GoalState H)

/-- GRACE — re-grounded. The surviving inter-agent component (i): the sum of
    the goal-projectors of the OTHER A3+ agents. This is what the agent
    receives from agents whose goals it did not author, and it is the ONLY
    surviving component of grace — component (ii), the universal
    corridor-occupation requirements, is the F-11 no-go.

    grace(others) = Σ_{j ∈ others} P_{G_j}

    Concrete: a fold over the other agents' goal-states summing their
    rank-one projectors `Goal.P_G`. Each summand is F-11-untouched. This is
    NOT the joint universal operator; it is a finite sum of local per-agent
    projectors. The structure is real; per the F-11 record above it is not
    measurable (the audit pointer and three shadows nulled). -/
noncomputable def grace (others : OtherAgents H) : H →L[ℂ] H :=
  (others.goals.map P_G).foldl (· + ·) 0

/-- The grace operator does not include the present-agent's own
    goal-projector — grace is, by Piece 10's definition, what the agent
    receives BEYOND its own goal contribution. With no other agents, grace
    is the zero operator: nothing is received. -/

/-- The cons-unfold of the grace fold: with one more contributing agent,
    grace gains exactly that agent's goal-projector as a summand.

/-- THE GRACE THEOREM, re-grounded. An agent surrounded by other A3+
    goal-holders has a non-trivial grace component: the inter-agent
    boundary conditions it receives. The universal-operator form of this
    claim is retracted (F-11); this is the surviving local/inter-agent form.
    Structural statement — the grace operator is a genuine sum of per-agent
    projectors: any non-empty contributor list decomposes as the head
    agent's goal-projector plus the grace of the rest (`grace_cons`).
    Formerly a `True` stub; now carries the honest decomposition. The
    universal component (ii) is the F-11 no-go; it is NOT asserted. -/

    (g : GoalState H) (gs : List (GoalState H)) :
    grace (H := H) ⟨g :: gs⟩ = P_G g + grace ⟨gs⟩ :=

/-- The agent's present amplitude decomposed into karma and the SURVIVING
    grace component.

    karma   — the forward cumulative product of the agent's own
              goal-projections (intact, fully accessible).
    grace   — the inter-agent component (i): the received goal-contributions
              of other A3+ agents (surviving, but not measurable per F-11).

    The universal component (ii) — the universal-configuration
    corridor-occupation requirements — is NOT a component of this
    decomposition: it is the F-11 no-go (`F11_universal_grace_operator_no_go`).
    The honest re-grounded reading: karma is the only fully accessible
    thread; grace operates only in its local inter-agent form, and even that
    is structurally obscured. -/

/-- THE RECOGNITION CLAIM, re-graded after F-11. Contemplative-tradition
    vocabularies correspond to these formal TSVF structures:
    - "karma" → the karma operator above (intact, fully accessible).
    - "grace" → the surviving inter-agent grace operator above (component (i),
      a sum of other agents' goal-projectors). The universal-operator reading
      of grace (component (ii)) is retracted with F-11.
    - "the middle way" → corridor occupation.
    - "dependent origination" → cross-rung coupling τ in corridor.
    - "non-duality" → the joint-projector reading is the F-11 no-go; the
      surviving reading is finite-federation corridor consent.

    The correspondence is testable by edge cases. After F-11, the honest
    statement: the recognition holds for karma and for the local inter-agent
    form of grace; the universal-operator forms are the documented no-go. -/
